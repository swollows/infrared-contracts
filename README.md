## What is Infrared

The Infrared Protocol revolutionizes the way users engage with the Berachain ecosystem, particularly in how they stake consensus assets and and receive the [Proof-of-Liquidity inflation](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-proof-of-liquidity#what-is-proof-of-liquidity). It enables users to stake their assets effortlessly and receive IBGT, a liquid staked representation of BGT, significantly enhancing BGT's utility.

This README aims to provide auditors with a comprehensive overview of the Infrared Protocol, exploring its innovative architecture and the dynamics among its core components: Infrared, InfraredVault, IBGT, and IBGTVault. Each component is integral in offering a seamless liquid staking experience, allowing participants to earn rewards while ensuring liquidity within the Berachain ecosystem.

The Infrared Protocol is designed to democratize access to staking, fostering broader participation and reinforcing network security. In this document, we'll navigate through the protocol's mechanisms, smart contract functions, and the security frameworks established to safeguard user assets.
